- 👋 Hi, I’m Lili Teister
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Analytics and work as a Business Intelligence Analyst in the healthcare non-profit sector, where I enjoy creating reports, dashboards, and insights to help our company serve our membership and be efficient.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Analytics at Georgia Tech, expecting to earn my Master of Science by 2024.
- 💞️ My profile is just a sample of code I have written for learning or to curate data for my own exploration and projects or visualizations.
